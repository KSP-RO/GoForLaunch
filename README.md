# GoForLaunch
The repository for the [Go For Launch collaborative RP-0 career](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132795-go-for-launch-cooperative-rorssrp-0/).

This repository and in particular its wiki will serve as a central place for all Go For Launch-related files and documentation.

The current version of GameData (should be exactly the same across all installs participating!) may be obtained [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oh1htgqc3ljpfcr/GFL_KSP112?dl=1). Updated May 14th 2016.
